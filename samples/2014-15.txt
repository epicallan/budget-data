(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
Lack of a maintenance workshop and a maintenance fund for maintaining infrastructure and equipments. Funds
had to be solicited for other activities to repair the Theatre machines and X-Ray machines.
There is need for more supplementary funding for the additional requirements for the completion of renovation
of wards and other incomplete works at the hospital.
The court cases for the land wrangles and need to process the land title require funding that had no provision in
the budget. Budget shows 101.3% on non wage because of the supplementary budget for wage, pensions and
gratuity.
The unspent balances were due to the delayed completion of works caused by the delay in release of funds.
Human resource required urgently for the accounts section, procurement and stores.

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
There were delays in the delivery of imported items for medical equipment,solar panels and batteries due to the
fluctuations in exchange rate. The funds for the purchase of medicines were not enough and this resulted in
regular stock outs mostly at the end of each quarter. Generally the allocation for stationary,allowances, fuel and
maintenance of government vehicles was not enough. There are limited funds for stationery and this has made it
difficult for the hospital to run smoothly. The over expenditure on capital development is due funds carreid
forward from the previous FY 2013/14 which were already committed but payments were made in FY 2014/15.

Allocation for fuel,allowances and maintenance of government vehicles needs to be revised if most of the
activities have to be carried on. There is constant loadshedding in Kigezi region and the hospital relies on the
generator most of the time which is very expensive. The movements to Kampala on duty is very expensive and
hence the allocation for fuel needs to be revised. Allocation of funds for stationery and medicines is limited and
these form core activities within the hospital.Hence if most of the activities have to be performed there is need to
revise the budgetary allocations to satisfy the growing need. The Accounting Officer will strengthen the records
department inorder for it to come out with accurate and reliable data.

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
Masaka Regional Referral Hospital is on schedule for wage and NWR activities during the FY 2014/15. There
has been positive variances caused by funding provided for Pension and Gratuity. There has been increases in the
number of vaccinations given where we overshot the hospital target. Payment on Maternity construction also
overshoot because of funded reallocated from Staff Hostel to Maternity construction.
The entity has lagged behind in execution of some capital development projects because of administrative
review. However the entity implemented all the projects. There is insufficient funding of maternity and children's
complex which has halted its progress.

Capture of patient’s data has remained a challenge due to lack of skilled manpower, lack of data capture tools for
specialist conditions, multiple reporting tools, under delivery of patient’s stationary by NMS. The staff have not
been sensitized about new HMIs tools has not been.

Delay in replacing staffs that are transferred, retired or absconded from duty.

Increased patient numbers with a constricted staffing norms, low staffing levels and inadequate infrastructure.

However procurement and use of the two Ultrasound machines has catapulted utilisation of imaging services.

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
Litle funding that made it difficult for Capital development program to take off. Drugs stock out due to limitted
funding visavis the big catchment area of 4M people served by the Hospital. There was a release of pensions and
gratuity funds which were not intially in the ceilling during the budgeting process. This contributed to releases
of Non wage reccurrent figures to be above 100%

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
Delayed release of funds during the quarter, leading to delayed execution of budget activities. The
decentralization of pensions and gratuity has led to more funds being released in the 3rd and 4th quarted to cater
for the payments. Thus additional shs. 93,222,498 was released, hence an increase in the quarterly allocation by
similar amount. There was realocation from advertisement and publicity, fuel and travel inland amounting to shs.
15,000,000 to capital development to cater for the clearance of V.A.T on the generator donated.

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
the hospital faces a challenge of inadequate staffing and inaqdequate budget allocation. We also face a challenge
of overcrowding of patients at the Out patient department which as a result of the small and dilapidated structure.
The hospital urgently needs an oxgyen plant to fully operationalize the Theatre and Intensive Care Unit. There
was under performance for Non wage due to the limited number of employees slated for Pension and Gratuity.
NTR was underestimated at the time of budgeting. The construction of staff houses is on-going and the last slab
is completed and raising of the wall for the last floor has commenced.

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
No significant variances have been experienced during budget execution in the third quarter. However the
greatest challenge remains with the under budgeted items like printed medical forms and stationery making it
difficult to correct data. The item of printed medical forms-HMIS forms had been earlier planned to be delivered
by NMS which has remained inconsistent. Continued power cuts also put a lot of pressure on the fuel budget.
We plan to have a dedicated power line from the sub-station which is about one kilometre away at a cost to be
communicated following a concluded survey. The other challenge has been with supply of oxygen which is
irregular and inadequate. Plans are are under way to install our oxygen plant with support from stake holders.
The other challenge is with the fencing of the hospital which has multiple entries and management of client flow,
attendants and visitors making health care work very difficult and increases insecurity. The hospital also lacks an
efficient incenerator to manage the wastes especially harzadous medical wastes.

dilapidated leading to congestion, waste disposal and drainage problems complicatind infection control thus
innapropriate service delivery. Most of the equipment that has been on service warrant have been taken up by
the hospital after expiry of the warranty and it is costly to maintain since the technicians are not within the
country and most of the time are called in from Nairobi and the spares are equally expensive. Some key
equipment is also still missing like digital x-ray, c-arm and MRI. The hospital continues to experience challenges
of timely delivery of medicines and related supplies in sufficient quantities with a continous challenge of getting
oxygen.These challenges are envisaged to be carried forward in the subsquent quarters. Hospital data
compilation is facing challenges due to lack of electronic equipment for data capture and even unskilled medical
records staff who don’t capture all the data accurately leading to underperfomance rating and distortion of
planning.

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
The construction of the1st phase (10 units) of staff houses iscomplete, awaits hand over and payment FY
2015/16. capital development allocation for FY 2015/16 of shs504m is inadequate to continue to phase two and
three of the staffing house constructucion. The 6 units of staff houses are complete, awaits occupancy and
payment FY 2015/16. The under absoption of the wage is because we were below the required staffing
levels(37%). The HSC, interviewed to fill various positions increasing staffing levels to 42.5%; one cosultant
was attracted. A sernior accountant was deployed to the hospital. Ministry of Public Service and Finance are
informed in writing over the staffing gaps at the Hospital; additional recritment is expected.

The issue of poor data capture was identified as a result of poor reporting of activities. This will be improved by
compiling all data from activities both within and outside the hospital.

QUARTER 4: Highlights of Vote Performance
Delays by the contractors as observed in the previous quarters may still occur in the present quarter. Involvement
of local communities and leaders in supervision and monitoring of the projects will bear the necessary pressure
on the contractors to follow their work schedule. Clauses in the contract document will be enforced to ensure that
the contractor follows the schedule.
Delays in some stages of procurement process which affects timely delivery of supplies and services and
payments. We plan to have strict adherence to procurement plans and sensitive key stake holders in the
procurement process to increase efficiency in the execution of the plans.
Issues of emergencies affect execution of procurement plans and also the budget. For example increased referrals
to Mulago, and Mbale Hospitals as result of unavailability of some specialists and equipment to handle those
conditions. Recruitment of more staff especially specialists will ameliorate this .

(ii) Matters to note in budget execution
The key aspect to improving the link between planned sector outputs and final outcomes lies with the level and
manner in which resources are budgeted, allocated, approved and disbursed. Delays at any level impacts
negatively on the sequential processes in the implementation of the activities which finally has a bearing on the
yields in the planned positive outcomes.

The main issue in the budget execution has been delays or lengthy procurement process that lead to low
absorption of funds due to the Framework contract approach – for example in procurement on some of the
contracts such as drilling, supplies and services to avert lengthy delays in the repetitive process so that
implementation of the planned activities are done on time.

Another issue is the alignment of donor figures into the chart of accounts in respect to the approved figures. It
would make work more efficient if the donor figures use the same input method as the GoU system.
